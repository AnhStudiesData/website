  <p> <center>
  With our elongating shadows on the paved street lined up, <br>
  I'm walking together with you in the twilight. <br>
  As our hands are held, if only you could stay beside me forever, <br>
  I would be so happy that I could end up in tears. <br>
  <center> </p>
  
  <p>
  The wind has become frigid, <br>
  and the scent of winter is apparent. <br>
  Very soon that season will arrive at this town, <br>
  the season when I can stay close to you.<br>
  </p>
  
  <p>
  When we cuddle up together, <br>
  gazing at the first snow of this year, <br>
  during this moment, <br>
  happiness begins to flow all over me. <br>
  I'm neither being spoiled nor weak; <br>
  I simply love you; I really think so <br>
  from the bottom of my heart.<br>
  </p>
  
  <p>
  As long as we stay together, I have a feeling <br>
  that we'd be able to overcome any kind of hardship. <br>
  I sincerely pray that days like this <br>
  will continue forever and ever.<br>
  </p>
  
  <p>
  The wind knocks on the window, <br>
  and shakes the night awake. <br>
  No matter what kind of sorrows, <br>
  I'll help you turn them into smiles.<br>
  </p>

  <p>
  The snowflakes keep falling <br>
  outside our window; <br>
  not knowing when to stop, <br>
  they continue dyeing our town white. <br>
  The impulse to do something <br>
  for a certain someone you care about <br>
  is called "love", as I have just learned.<br>
  </p>
  
  <p>
  Even if I should have lost sight of you, <br>
  I can become a star and continue shining on you. <br>
  Be it smiles or nights soaked in tears, <br>
  I'll always stay by you forever.<br>
  </p>

  When we cuddle up together, <br>
  gazing at the first snow of this year, <br>
  during this moment, <br>
  happiness begins to flow all over me. <br>
  I'm neither being spoiled nor weak; <br>
  I simply want to stay this way together with you; <br>
  I think so from the bottom of my heart.<br>
  </p>
  
  <p>
  The pure-white snowflakes <br>
  piled up on the streets <br>
  will sketch new memories onto our hearts. <br>
  From now on, too, we'll stick together...<br>
